## Background

I initially created Keep2Log to migrate my own notes from Google Keep to Logseq. After experiencing the convenience and usefulness of this conversion process, I decided to share the tool on GitHub for others who may be facing similar needs. I hope Keep2Log helps you easily transition your notes from Google Keep to Logseq and enhances your note-taking experience.
